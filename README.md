Button Jack daemon
==================

Designed for onyx. Needs modified kernel.

Make more use for your headset/earphone buttons.

If your headset has only one button, it will most propably control active mpris player play/pause.

If you have 2 additional buttons, short presses will change volume, long presses will change next/previous track
