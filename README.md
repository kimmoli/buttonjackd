Button Jack daemon
==================

Designed for onyx. Needs modified kernel.

Make more use for your headset/earphone buttons.

If your headset has only one button, it should
* Control mediaplayer play/pause over mpris
* Answer to incoming call
* Hangup an active call

If you have 2 additional buttons, they should
* Change volume with short press
* Change track with long (>1 sec) press
